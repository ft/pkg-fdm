    excessive memory allocation with broken mails. (Closes: #595057)

fdm (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    scripts as the policy wants it (although I really fail to see how that
    implicit technique is any better than the explicit and very clear
    '|| exit 1' which the package used before).
  * Removing 04support_debianbsds.diff, included upstream.
